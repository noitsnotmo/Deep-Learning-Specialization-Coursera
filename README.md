# 2. Improving Deep Neural Networks: Hyperparameter Tuning, Regularization and Optimization

OBJECTIVES:
- Learn the best practices to train and develop test sets and analyze bias/variance for building deep learning applications.  
- Be able to use standard neural network techniques such as initialization, L2 and dropout regularization, hyperparameter tuning, batch normalization, and gradient checking.  
- Implement and apply a variety of optimization algorithms, such as mini-batch gradient descent, Momentum, RMSprop and Adam, and check for their convergence.  
- Implement a neural network in TensorFlow.
